I'm a software developer and an advocate for accessible user experiences. I am currently based in Lagos, Nigeria. I am also a co-lead at [frontend weekly](http://frontendweekly.dev/), where my colleagues and I discuss topic relating to front-end development and general software engineering.

Welcome to my corner of the web.
